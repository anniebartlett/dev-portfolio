                  Hey, I'm Annie. I'm a full-stack web developer based in
                  London.
                </p>
                <p className="leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  After 7 years working in Fashion Merchandising at Asos, I
                  decided to retrain and embark a new journey as a web
                  developer.
                </p>
                <p className="leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  Life took another turn and in Feb 2020 I gave birth to my
                  little son Henry.
                </p>
                <p className="leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  I've always loved tech and design, so in April 2020 I made one
                  of the best decisions to take part in the Le Wagon part-time
                  bootcamp whilst on maternity leave.
                </p>
                <p className="leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  I learned the fundamentals of code through Ruby, as well as
                  HTML5, CSS3 and JS, React and Node (Bootstrap and milk bottles
                  became the norm!)
                </p>
                <p className="leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  I love making beautiful digital products, combining technology
                  with creative ideas.
